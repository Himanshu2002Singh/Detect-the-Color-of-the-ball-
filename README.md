Task:
In the video provided in the link below, write a Computer Vision program to detect the color of the balls and get the timestamps of each ball entering and exiting the quadrants. Record the below details for each event (ball entering or exiting a numbered quadrant).
Time, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour, Type (Entry or Exit)
Timestamp: consider start of the video as 0 seconds and compute timestamp based on video duration.
The program should have provisions for feeding a new video and output should be saved in the local hard disk. Details of which need to be shared at the time of submission.

Video to process:

Output expected:
The model you create should take the video as input and give the below output.
Processed video - Print event identifiers (Entry/Exit), Ball track with ball color, Time stamp on the video itself at the relevant frames and objects.

Text file with records in the format provided above (Time, Quadrant Number, Ball Colour, Type (Entry or Exit))
